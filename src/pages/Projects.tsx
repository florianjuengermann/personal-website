              Looking at infinitely wide neural networks is a fruitful
              theoretical approach to understanding machine learning. In this
              limit, the networks' behavior can be precisely described by
              rigorous mathematical tools.{" "}

              Decision trees can be used as an explainable representation of
              controllers (a.k.a. strategies, policies). To model more complex
              systems, we show how to sythesize algebraic splitting predicates
              for the decision tree nodes.{" "}

              Solving differential equations is hard. We use physics-informed
              neural networks (PINNs) to learn a solution. The loss function
              describes how well the differential equation is satisfied at
              certain sample points. <br />

              Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a technique for
              simulating the physical behavior of fluids or solid matter. It is
              based on simulating individual particles and interpolating the
              fluid behavior from those. We use{" "}
              <i>high performance computing</i> techniques such as OpenMP and
              MPI to speed up those simulations for simulating collisions on a
              planetary scale.

              Consider a database of users and movies where each entry in the
              matrix describes the rating a user gave a movie. This matrix is
              sparse and we are interested in predicting the missing entries. In
              this project, we consider the case where the missingness is not
              random. E.g. a user does not like horror movies and thus does not
              rate them.{" "}

              Worked on a satellite to orbit the earth on a low earth orbit. The
              project goal was to take pictures and send them back via optical
              data transmission. High-power LEDs would allow higher bandwidth in
              clear nights. I mainly worked on the ADCS system, running
              simulations and developing embedded code.{" "}
